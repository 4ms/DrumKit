# DrumKit

Drum Modules for VCVRack.

A work in progress.

## Currently

### BD-9

16 bass drums from TR909.

## Building

Building requires [SynthDevKit](https://github.com/JerrySievert/SynthDevKit),
which will be checked out as part of the build initialization.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JerrySievert/DrumKit
$ cd DrumKit
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ make
```
